This repository originally held 
a number of files for converting 
csv files to mysql databases. 
Currently it only holds a small 
script for displaying mysql tables.

# Pretty display

The aim of the pretty_sql.py 
script is singular: to display 
tables from a mysql connector 
like tables are displayed in the 
terminal when accessing mysql 
databases directly there.
